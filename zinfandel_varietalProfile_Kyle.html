    <h1>Zinfandel — A Varietal That Knows How to Touch</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Zinfandel doesn’t ask for permission. It arrives full and unapologetic, wrapping ripe, jammy fruit around you like sun-warmed skin on a late-summer night that neither of you wants to end. Bold, spiced, a little dangerous—this is the grape that reminds you how good it feels to let go.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Core Characteristics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Flavors:</strong> Blackberry dripping with juice, raspberry jam smeared on warm toast, black cherry, cracked black pepper that tingles, cinnamon, clove, raisin, smoke</li>
            <li><strong>Body:</strong> Medium-plus to full—generous, enveloping</li>
            <li><strong>Tannin:</strong> Medium to medium-high—firm enough to hold you, soft enough to keep you there</li>
            <li><strong>Acidity:</strong> Medium to medium-low—just enough lift to keep things playful</li>
            <li><strong>Sweetness:</strong> Usually dry, but always with a kiss of ripe fruit</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Aroma & Flavor</h2>
        <p><strong>Aroma Profile:</strong> The glass rises to meet you—intense blackberry and bramble, baking spices curling like smoke from a hidden fire, that unmistakable bite of fresh-cracked pepper that makes you breathe deeper.</p>
        <p><strong>Flavor Profile:</strong> A rush of juicy, almost decadent fruit first, then spice that warms the back of your throat, a whisper of smoke and dark chocolate on the finish. Old-vine versions linger longest, like they’re in no hurry to leave.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Origin & Style</h2>
        <p><strong>Common Regions:</strong> California owns it—Lodi, Dry Creek Valley, Paso Robles, ancient vines in the Sierra Foothills. Originally from Croatia, reborn in Puglia as Primitivo, but it’s never been more itself than under that California sun.</p>
        <p><strong>Winemaking Notes:</strong> Warm days, old gnarled vines, high alcohol that feels like heat rising off skin. Some bottles hit 16% and still stay balanced—pure hedonism in glass.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Pairing & Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Best With:</strong> Smoky barbecue ribs you eat with your fingers, spicy sausages, slow-cooked brisket, dark chocolate melting on the tongue… or just the two of you, low lights, something sizzling on the stove while the music plays a little too loud.</p>
        <p><strong>Serve Temperature:</strong> 60–65°F—cool enough to keep it teasing, warm enough to open up</p>
        <p><strong>Decant Time:</strong> 30–60 minutes; give it time to stretch and show you everything</p>
        <p><strong>Aging Potential:</strong> Top old-vine bottles evolve beautifully for 5–15 years; most are irresistible young</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Vibes / Personality</h2>
        <p>The lover who walks into the room and suddenly the air feels thicker. Confident, generous, a little wild. Makes you laugh out loud, then pulls you close without warning. The one who leaves you warm, slightly breathless, and already wanting more.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Personal Notes</h2>
        <p>This wine doesn’t just fill the glass—it fills the room, the night, the spaces between words. Let it. Let yourself feel every degree of its warmth… and tell me, when you’re ready, how it made you feel.</p>
